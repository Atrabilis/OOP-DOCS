## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm whose primary goal is to promote **clean code** and maintainability by organizing software around **objects** and their interactions.

### What clean code **does NOT** do

- **Improve execution speed**  
  It focuses on readability and maintainability, not on low-level performance optimizations.  
- **Guarantee correctness**  
  While it makes spotting and fixing bugs easier, it doesn't eliminate bugs by itself.  
- **Exist only in object-oriented programming**  
  Clean code principles apply across all paradigms.

### What clean code **DOES** do

- **Enhance readability**  
  Allows developers to understand, review, and modify code more quickly.  
- **Ease debugging**  
  Makes identifying and resolving errors simpler thanks to clear, consistent structures.  
- **Accelerate development**  
  Reduces cognitive load, speeding up the implementation of new features and changes.  
- **Preserve team sanity**  
  Encourages consistency and clarity, making daily work more pleasant.
